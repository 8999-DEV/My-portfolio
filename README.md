# Lookalike One-Page Portfolio

An original one-page portfolio inspired by common developer portfolio layouts. Includes sticky navigation, smooth scrolling, responsive sections, animations, and placeholders for images and resume.

## Files
- `index.html` — markup
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — interactivity (scroll, menu, reveals, contact mailto)
- `assets/` — placeholder images and `Resume.pdf`

## Run
Open `index.html` in a browser. For best results, serve with a local static server.

## Customize
- Change name/role, bio, experience, projects, and contact links in `index.html`.
- Replace images in `assets/` with your own.
- Replace `assets/Resume.pdf` with your real resume or update the download link.
- Update email in `script.js` (`to = 'you@example.com'`).

## Deploy
Host the folder on Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or any static host.
